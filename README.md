# VR Flight Simulator

An attempt at creating a virtual reality flight simulator solely using the Oculus Rift Touch controllers (and rudder pedals if available). The aircraft is a Piper PA-28 Archer II (presented as a low poly model in Unity). 

## Getting Started

### Configuring Unity
1. Download Unity Project from [Project Page](https://github.com/BigBallerBrand/flightSimulator.git)
2. Extract the folder from the .ZIP
3. Open the folder as a new project in Unity

### Configuring X-Plane 10

1. Configure Graphics Settings
   - Select **Settings** from the menu bar
   - Select **Rendering Options**
   - 


2. Configure Data Output Screen
   - Select **Settings** from the menu bar
   - Select **Data Input & Output**


## Deployment

### Running X-Plane

1. Ensure X-Plane is configured properly
2. Before starting Unity, start X-Plane using the **Cessna 172** Aircraft (ideally, you would use a Piper PA-28 II but X-Plane doesn't provide it as a default aircraft so the Cessna 172 has the closest handling specifications)
3. Press the **b** key to disengage the brake

### Running Unity

1. Open the **flightSimulator** project (or whatever name you called the project) in **Unity**
2. Once you have configured and started X-Plane, press the **Play** button
